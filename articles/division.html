<p>The lead of the pencil snapped again. Brian threw it down onto the worksheet with a snort of hot air through his nose. He slumped back into his chair and folded his arms. Dad picked the pencil off the sheet and carefully inserted the tip into the electric sharpener on the far side of the desk, setting off the sound of mechanical grinding. </p>
<br>
<p>"Why do I have to do this?" Brian asked for the third time that night. Dad looked at him sympathetically. He knew that Brian wasn't looking for an answer to this question, so much as for the question to be heard. The sound of the sharpener changed shifted into a higher tone. Dad pulled it out and put it on the table in front of Brian. Brian picked it up at first like it was an old banana peel, then suddenly gripped it in his fist. Dad watched as his knuckles turned white. </p>
<br>
<p>"Ready to look at problem sixteen again?" Dad asked. Brian leaned forward over the sheet with the pencil in his fist. Problem sixteen, like all the other problems on the sheet, was long division. Brian had excelled in math, even division, up to this point, but by using his memorized times table instead of learning how to actually do the division. </p>
<br>
<p>He tried to start with the first digit, find the largest multiple that fit, record it in the quotient, then subtract the product from the first digit, and repeat, but managed to get it incorrect again. Dad shook his head and reached for the eraser. Brian got to it first, and started erasing like a maniac, his body hunched over the paper in mockery of a studious focus. </p>
<br>
<p>"Why do I have to do this?"</p>
<p>"Because you have to learn."</p>
<p>"Why do I have to learn? Computers can do all of this. I'm never going to have to use this."</p>
<p>"That's why you have to learn." </p>
<br>
<p>Brian turned his head with aggressive disbelief. Dad knelt down and gently took hold of the back of the chair and rotated it so Brian faced him. "What you have is a gift, to have the chance to do these problems." </p>
<br>
<p>"Some gift," Brian murmured under his breath. </p>
<p>Dad continued. "The kids at the inner-city school have the same problems on the same worksheet, but their lesson is on how to enter the numbers into the computer. When they graduate, that's all they're going to be able to do, and all they're going to be able to do when they get their jobs."</p>
<p>Brian looked at Dad skeptically. "Isn't that all anyone does at work now?"</p>
<p>Dad nodded. "For the most part, yes." Brian looked triumphant. "But the real innovation, the jobs that require creativity, require that you know not just how to get an answer from a machine, but how to understand what the computer does and what the answer you get means."</p>
<br>
<p>Dad looked at Brian. "You wanted to be an inventor, right?" Brian nodded. Ever since his school had taught on Edison and his inventions, Brian had heard the siren call of that sort of life. "To be an inventor means to do come up with an idea that no one has had before. If someone can get ideas from a computer, that means that someone else has already come up with them before. That's why you're in this special school program. We realized that there are really important ideas that we need people to come up with, but they can't do that unless they can understand everything that goes into it.</p>
<br>
<p>"It's like rungs on a ladder. Right now division feels useless because it's such a low rung, but you need it to climb higher and higher. The kids who don't get taught like this aren't able to climb as high-" Dad caught himself. "Well, it's a lot harder to climb higher if your ladder is missing rungs."</p>
<br>
<p>Brian looked down at the sheet, and the disgusting pencil laying next to it on the desk. "Then why don't we let the kids at the city school to learn too?" </p>
<p>Dad let out a sigh. "Well, in a better world, everyone would have the chance to learn like this. But for every inventor, the world needs maybe a hundred people to do less creative jobs, so some people get to learn like you, and some people don't."</p>
<br>
<p>"You always told me I could grow up to be anything I wanted." Brian said. "But does that mean that if I went to he city school, I wouldn't be able to be an inventor anymore?"</p>
<p>Dad looked at Brian. "You still could, it would just be a lot harder. And you'd probably have to learn a lot of this by yourself instead of being able to learn through school. That's why we tried so hard and paid so much money to get you into this program."</p>
<br>
<p>Brian picked the pencil off the desk and looked at problem sixteen. "Okay Dad, I guess I'll try again."</p>
