<p>The one thing that Miriam never got used to was the smell. It hit her every time she stepped off of the small biplane to the landing strip maintained by the expedition outpost. This was her third journey into the jungle. As she took another deep breath, trying to acclimate herself, she felt sweat bead on her forehead and in her armpits. She looked over at Father Alan who was still in his black Jesuit robe, complete with a pristine white collar. She knew he would keep this on the whole trip, but would roll up his sleeves and cheekily skip into a pair of sandals once they arrived in the village.</p>

<p>The village was still another three hour's ride away from the outpost on an old army jeep with suspension so old it was mostly talismanic. Besides herself and Father Alan, there was also Jakob, another graduate student from Poland. He studied linguistics at a Jesuit university in Poland, and the Order had coordinated adding him to our program's trip. Jakob studied linguistics. Father Alan's objective in this was largely humanitarian. In addition to spiritual counsel, he brought along two trunks of medical supplies. He came every other year or so for the last two decades, and had spent many nights here doing everything from pulling teeth to delivering children. Of course, he also performed baptisms and last rites as he is able, but for the most part he was respectful of the villages' customs, religious or otherwise.</p>

<p>Miriam's interest anthropological. She enrolled in Father Alan's course at Boston College when she was an undergrad and was fascinated by his stories about traveling the world as a Jesuit doctor. He left a high-paying job as a cardiologist after the death of his wife in childbirth to take to the cloth. The order had sent him across the world to all sorts of people, using his medical skill to make inroads with people who otherwise might be closed off to him. Miriam saw him as the closest thing the world had to the sort of healer-cleric she and her friends used to play in their basement games of Dungeons and Dragons.</p>

<p>When the Anthropology program was considering supporting her for a trip, she had consulted Father Alan, who readily added her to the trip. Miriam was amazed how much faster the department moved when the might of the Jesuits on campus was leveraged in her favor. Suddenly, budgets and logistics were approved in days instead of months. Father Alan merely smiled when she shared this with him. "Ah yes." He nodded with a wink. "It is great to see that even in our time, the department understands the urgency of the work of the Lord."</p>

---------------------------

<p>The first day in the village was overwhelming. When they neared the village, children emerged out of the trees and began to run along side the jeep, which slowed down both to keep pace with them, and to adjust for the deteriorating dirt road. Father Alan waved and smiled, catching the eye of a few of the children he seemed to remember from the last trip. When they arrived, they were greeted and unloaded their belongings. The Jeep then trundled off back into the jungle, to emerge again in a month or so, depending on the rains.</p>

<p>That night, they had a meal with the whole village, who looked simultaneously very comfortable with each other, and very uncomfortable with them. Father Alan, however, was in his element. He smiled and laughed easily, passing out items he had brought as gifts for the members of the community. Soon, he was mobbed by the children that had escorted them along the road.</p>

<p>The next day, Father Alan got started in earnest. He looked twisted ankles, lanced ulcers, and gave vitamin shots. Miriam and Jakob quickly realized that if they wanted to make the trip worthwhile for them, they would need to make that happen themselves. They settled down into their respective fields of study, and began to explore the village and the villagers in it.</p>

<p>Without too much trouble, Jakob learned some basic vocabulary, and seemed to be able to string together some sentences, although almost everyone he tried them on made faces. Miriam had a working diagram of various social roles in the village and a network of relationships. Sometimes they wouldn't see Father Alan until dinner, when he would emerge, looking utterly exhausted and fulfilled. He seemed to both be able to communicate better and understand the relationships around him better than either Miriam or Jakob, despite showing no sign of putting effort into either.</p>

<p>After the first week, Miriam asked Jakob if he could help ask if there were any sites of worship around. He frowned, as none of the words he had learned seemed to inhabit that topic. However, he said that he would try. After a few confusing conversations, he returned to Miriam, shaking his head. Miriam shrugged. However, at the evening meal one day, a small boy came up to Jakob and said that his mom wanted to talk to him. Jakob and Miriam stood up and followed him to a woman named Salie. She said that she had heard about Jakob and Miriam's inquiries, and although they hadn't had any sort of thing in a long time, there was a "Place of Ancestors" to the East of the village. Villagers used to go there all the time, but they had forgotten it.</p>

<p>When Jakob translated all this to Miriam, she was confused. If they had forgotten it, how is it that Salie is telling us about it now? Jakob shrugged. He explained "forgetting is more active for them, not a passive status. To 'forget' about something is to put it behind them, not necessarily to no longer have memory or knowledge." Miriam asked if they could go see it, and Salie said that she would bring them tomorrow.</p>

<p>The next day, Father Alan found them in the morning. "I heard you were going on an expedition?"</p>
Miriam and Jakob looked sheepish and apologized for not checking in with him. Father Alan, instead, broke out in a big grin and said he wanted to come with them.</p>
<p>"No more broken bones to mend?" Miriam asked.</p>
<p>"No, and Alli is unlikely to give birth before next week, and Paulin is unlikely to die before then either." Father Alan grinned. "Let's go!"</p>

--------------------------

<p>While Salie and her son glided through the jungle with no more difficulty than a city sidewalk, Miriam and Jakob felt like they were constantly stumbling over everything in their way. Even Father Alan sometimes had to reach out for a branch of vine to steady himself. After over two hours of walking, they had descended into a wide but gentle swale. Salie pointed to the lowest point, but Miriam saw nothing. Having been humbled by her limitations, she followed the finger and was surprised to be met by a wall of vegetation that seemed to be an actual wall. Blocks of what seemed to be bark mimiced the shape of courses of stonework. Once her eyes adjusted to what she was looking for, she saw the shape of a rectangular room with small carveouts on the side. Sunlight streamed through the shingles of leaves on top, bathing the space in an emerald light. The layout reminded Miriam of the Dunhuang caves she had visited in undergrad.</p>

<p>"Wow, look at that" Miriam turned her head and saw Father Alan stepping into the little temple as well.</p>
<p>"What do you make of it?" Miriam asked him.</p>
<p>"Oh I don't know. I know the villagers always say that very different ancestors came before them, and always spoke like they were a different kind of people." Father Alan put a hand against one of the walls. "I always assumed that it was a sort of mythology of figures who discovered fire or taught the trees to grow. I guess I never figured that it was real."</p>

<p>In the middle of the temple was a raised base and on top of it was a vaguely anthropomorphic figure. It sort of resembled a standing body, but the head looked mask-like, and the limbs were very thin. Most interesting was the fact that the figure seemed to be carved out of the woody vines and branches that hung around it. Miriam found her camera and took a few shots. She asked Jakob to translate a few questions, but when asked who built the temple or when such a thing happened, Salie just shook her head. Forgotten indeed.</p>

-----------------------

<p>Miriam was writing in her notebook and going through some photographs shortly after Alli delivered a boisterous baby boy, she felt a vibration in the ground. She looked up, panicked, to see if anyone else had noticed. She caught the eye of one of the elders nearby. Jakob came up to them, and said "I'm not sure, but I think they're saying it's a rock slide." Miriam looked at the elder and made a sliding motion with her hand. The elder nodded his head. "It's happening to the east, isn't it?" Miriam asked. The elder nodded again.</p>

<p>Her heart sank. Surely the temple would have been damaged, if not completely destroyed. They had made a few trips out there under the guidance of Salie, but there was a lot more Miriam wanted to do. The next day, She asked if she could go out there again, just to assess the damage. Salie shrugged and said that she could just go with her son if she wanted to. As they walked through the jungle, Jakob had almost a full conversation with the young boy, who was likely 7 or 8. Miriam was impressed. Jakob explained that this language had almost an entirely different dialect for children than adults, and he could use either with a child, but was restricted to using the adult dialect with other adults.</p>

<p>When they began to descend into the swale, Miriam was blown away by the sheer volume of earth that had moved. With the rains, it looked like the slope further east had exfoliated an entire layer of rocks, dirt, and all the vegetation rooted in it. The ground was a mess, with heaps of tangled vegetation piled up in some spots, and bare, brown patches in other places. Some of the stones were also enormous, coming up to Miriam's waist and weighing thousands of pounds. She held her breath, hoping that one of these hadn't careened into the temple.</p>

<p>However, when the temple came into view, at first it looked like it had largely been spared. The walls were still there, defining an open space with a central plinth with a figure on it. However, the rockslide must have scraped away the vegetation, because whereas the walls had looked to be made of wooden branches before, the stonework was now visible. The walls were now courses of large rocks the width of Miriam's hand, carefully staggered and tiled. The figure in the middle had apparently gotten scrubbed clean as well, since the figure was now bare stone. However, it incredibly still looked the same. The shape of the mask-like head was still alluring and grotesque, and the slender limbs, fully intact, framed the idol's swaying pose.</p>

<p>Miriam got her camera out and took a few more photos. Despite the local catastrophe, this idol, this entire temple seemed miraculously fine. In fact, some aspects of it looked even better than before. It had not only survived, it seems to have been indifferent to the massive shift in the earth around it.</p>

<p>That night, Miriam opened her notebook in the last rays of the dying sun to write yet another log and record ephemeral notes from the day. To help her recollection, she pulled up some photos of the temple on her camera screen. As she flicked between newer photos of the temple and older ones, she was once again amazed that every single dimension and detail of the idol seemed to have been preserved, as if what was pulsating greenery had simply turned into stone. If anything, the features of the idol's face, its large luminous eyes, seemed to be more pronounced. The raking noon light in the photos created shadows and layers of depth Miriam hadn't noticed before. The pose of the idol, which once had seemed stiff and sinister, now looked naturalistic and reposed.</p>

--------------

<p>Soon after, Father Alan got word that the rains would clear road through the jungle was now traversable. He said to anticipate being picked up in the next week or so. While Jakob looked relieved, Miriam panicked. She felt like the newness of everything was just beginning to wear off, and she thought she could finally focus on collating her observations into a semblance of a cohesive narrative.</p>

<p>That night, thunderstorms battered the roof of their borrowed home harder than ever before. Miriam lay in the dark, watching the white flicker of light that would illuminate the room, followed by a loud crashing bass that tore through the crash of rain.</p>

<p>"Miriam, look!" Jakob cried from the crack in the door he was peering through. Miriam stuck her head out the door and saw that a lightning had lit a fire off in the distance. "That won't come towards us, right?" Jakob asked. However, as they watched, the rains soon smothered the fire, and plumes of black, heavy smoke were almost visible against the lightning flashes.</p>

<p>When the morning's rays finally broke over the horizon, Miriam wanted to go out to assess the damange to the temple, but was worried about the smoke still rising to the east. Saide shurgged and said that it was probably fine since the fire had been steadily dying down. For the first time, Miriam went alone. She was sure she had memorized the path, even given the heavy rains. </p>

<p>As she descended into the swale, the smell of smoke got stronger and stronger. Soon, she was walking by smouldering back patches of vegetation with glowing embers dancing inside larger branches of wood like a window into a warm house on a cold night.

<p>The temple finally came into view, and Miriam saw that it had some open flames licking the walls. The idol and pedestal had clearly been burnt, as the visible portions were charred and black. But the flames that came out of it looked peculiar. Instead of radiating out and up, they seemed to follow the same contours of the shape of the idol. </p>

<p>Braving the heat, Miriam walked up to the idol and pulled out her water bottle. She unscrewed the cap and slowly emptied her half-full bottle onto the idol. Beneath the cascade of water, the idol crumbled away, collapsing into a pile of ash onto the plinth. Once the bottle of water ran empty, Miriam slowly withdrew it and screwed the cap back on. She was reaching to put it back into her rucksack when suddenly she saw shifting in front of her. </p>

<p>The watery ash and broken bits of charcoal had begun to climb upwards. As if it were living, the sludge first formed a pair of feet, then legs, then a waist and torso. Last, the sludge formed itself into the head of the idol, with its large eyes and mask-like face. </p>

<p>Miriam stared, not believing her eyes. The idol was somehow the same shape it was when it stone or wood, just made out of a different material. She scrambled to pull her camera out of her backpack. cursing as the strap caught on the zipper of her pack. She flipped back to the first photos she had taken of the idol and confirmed her suspicion. With the only difference being the texture of the material, the shape was exactly identical. </p>

<p>She stayed until sundown to see if any other changes would take place, but nothing happened. Hunger clawed at her stomach and she wanted to make it back before dark, so she headed back to the village. </p>

<p>That night, she was furiously trying to record her recollections in her journal. The idea that this thing was changing and transforming all the time tortured her. If only she could stay and watch! An idea struck her. She had brought along a small action camera. What if she set it up to take a long time lapse?</p>

<p>She was digging through her luggage to look for the action camera and its batteries when Jakob walked in. </p>
<p>"What are you looking for?" Jakob asked.</p>
<p>"I have this GoPro I need" responded Miriam, pushing back a lock of hair that was annoyingly dangling over her face.</p>
<p>"For what?" </p>

<p>Miriam explained what she had seen to him. Jakob looked surprised, but just nodded. At the end, he asked "Do you want to use my..." He paused for a second, then held his hand flat in front of him and panned it around, making robot noises. Miriam was reminded for the first time in a while that English wasn't his first language. </p>

<p>What Jakob was refering to was motorized pan-tilt head that he had brought along in order to track subjects as they were recording. As a linguist, being able to aim a directional microphone at a speaking subject was apparently very important, so when Jakob was an undergraduate, he used a small single-board computer and a few servos to motorize the tracking. With its small footprint and energy consumption, the computer and the batteries sat in an enclosure the size of Miriam's palm, and the armature with the servos and a small OLED screen showing the angles of each servo sat on top of the base.</p>

<p>After showing her how it worked, Jakob showed Miriam how to mount the camera and plug the battery into the computer's battery. He also had a rugged solar charger that they could hook up as well to try to get the setup going as long as possible.</p>

<p>The next day, Miriam and Jakob made the journey out to the temple again. Miriam marched right up to the idol, noticing that whereas it was had been a dark grey of wet ash and water, the water must have evaporated, because the idol now looked pale and dusty. However, they soon realized there was a problem. They had no way to set the device up. Miriam suggested stacking their bags and setting it on top of there, but Jakob had a better idea. "Let's put it on the roof". </p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Miriam asked.</p>
<p>"It's solar anyway," Jakob shrugged. "If we put it on the roof, we can angle the camera down and see it from there."</p>
<p>Miriam saw the logic in this. The "roof", when they first arrived, had been an almost-full leafy canopy. However, after the rock slide and the fire, it had been reduced to just a few branches spanning over the enclosing walls of the temple. Jakob carefully scaled up the wall from the outside and gingerly placed the camera setup on the branch that looked thickest. He punched a few buttons on the enclosure, and the motors sprang to life, angling the camera down. From below, Miriam called out "Left... Left.... Up...." until the camera was perfectly pointed at the idol. </p>

<p>After climbing down, Jakob was entirely covered in dust and soot. He looked dismayed as Miriam laughed and helped him brush off. </p>

<p>Since the camera was recording, they had nothing else to do, so after making sure everything looked like it was working, they headed back.</p>

---------------------

<p>A few days later, Miriam figured it was time to pick up the camera and get the footage. After all, the camera's card only had so much storage capacity anyway. Jakob was busy, so she went by herself.</p>

<p>When she arrived, she carefully climbed up to where the camera was and carefully plucked it from its perch. She saw that although the storage card was full, the unit's batteries were still more than half full, owing to the sunny days they've had since the last torrential downpour. She swapped the memory cards and climbed back up to replace the camera.</p>

<p>Miriam got it what she thought was close, but when she climbed down, realized that she had set the camera pretty askew. She climbed back up again, reaching over the wall and reaching for the buttons with an outstretched hand to grope for the buttons on the motorized base. After climbing down, she found that she had overcorrected. With a sigh, she climbed up again. </p>

<p>While she grasped blindly with her outstretched hand, one of her boots lost their purchase against the wall. She quickly threw her weight forward so she wouldn't fall. Her flailing hand knocked into the camera unit, and she watched in horror as the camera unit slid forward, then tumbled into the gap they had been using as a peep hole. </p>

<p>Climbing down as quickly as she could, Miriam raced into the temple to see whether or not it had broken. To her horror, the whole setup had tumbled directly onto the plinth. The idol, which was made of ash, had been flattened. </p>

<p>Miriam's eyes widened and she instinctively held her breath, afraid that moving would make it worse. </p>

<p>After a minute, she figured that she ought to pick the camera and computer out of the pile, right? If the idol was actually capable of reforming, then she should take the pile of wires and plastic out so it could do that. </p>

<p>She reached forward, but the instant she touched the edge of the black enclosure, it started to shift under her hand. Miriam jerked her hand back. The pile began to wiggle.</p>

<p>The bulky enclosure rose a bit, but then the plastic began to peel back like an orange, exposing the hardware underneath. The armature and servos began to wiggle as well as they were molded into the shape of the torso. The object seemed fluid for a moment, as everything Miriam thought of as rigid, flat, even, and square became embroiled in the gentle softening into a natural form. </p>

<p>When the idol finally stood still, it looked as it had before. The same exact shapes with different materials. Bits of the black enclosure streaked through the idol, twisting like a vine. The arms seemed to be primarily formed out of wires and electrical traces. The chest bore a glassy sheen. Miriam figured that this is where the OLED display and solar panels must have become. The face was a circuit-board green, and what was likely one of the camera lens objectives took the place of one of the eyes. It's spherical roundness seemed to catch the light and look at Miriam.</p>

<p>Miriam was transfixed. After the shock wore off, she reached for her other camera in her bag. After taking what felt like a hundred photos, she felt like she needed to go get Jakob and Father Alan. She quickly packed everything up and was ready to head back to the village, when a glint caught her eye. She approached the idol. </p>

<p>Suddenly, words flickered on what must have been the integrated OLED screen. </p>

<p>"Hello, Miriam"</p>
