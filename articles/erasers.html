<p>A Little while ago, I picked up a few lead holders to copy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bargue">Bargue Plates</a>. Of course, I found out that there's a subreddit dedicated to this, called <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/leadholders/">/r/leadholders</a>. There's some genuinely cool stuff on there. I didn't know that the lead holder is actually way older than the mechanical pencil, since it was possible to compress graphite and clay into a thicker stick (e.g. 2mm diameter) way before we could make 0.5mm or 0.7mm. As such, there's a lot of very vintage lead holders that go back to like 1802, when Joseph Hardtmuth patented mixing graphite with kaolin in Austria.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>This means that there are a lot of vintage lead holders that went out of production decades, if not centuries ago. These, of course, are highly sought after, and now command many times their original price on sites like eBay. For instance, just try to pick up a 2mm Conte Criterium or a Rotring 600, and you're looking at forking over a significant amount of cash. But almost invariably, when you see these vintage lead holders either in Reddit posts or online listings, they're very well worn and have clearly seen a lot of time in someone's hand. That's one thing that I find very cool about these lead holders, that they last so long and retain their functionality. </p>

<p>But the issue with the /r/leadholders community is that it's not very active. But you know what is active? <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/">/r/mechanicalpencils</a>. As of writing, Reddit reports that /r/leadholders has about 203 weekly visitors, whereas /r/mechanicalpencils has 38,000. The vibe over on /r/mechanicalpencils is... different. For one, gone are the distressed aluminum barrels, the worn brass sections. the barely-holding-on paint that once marked a draughtsman or artist's tool. Instead, it's hard to find even a single mechanical pencil on the sub that shows any sort of wear. I don't mean this necessarily critically, as the mechanical pencils on the sub tend to be higher-end, and are built for durability and longevity. Even several years of consistent use would not get them to show the sort of wear that you'd see on a vintage lead holder.</p>

<p>But besides that, there's also a word that /r/mechanicalpencils uses that is entirely absent in /r/leadholders- "haul". (Searching for "haul" in both subs gives 244 results in /r/mechanicalpencils and 0 in /r/leadholders.) For those who are not as chronically online as I, a "haul", in my borderline Gen-Z understanding, is a type of content where someone makes a conspicuously large purchase of a category of products. So for instance, a "book haul" would just be many books, but a "makeup haul" might be many different kind of makeup products. While it's not uncommon to see several different posts all showing a "haul" on the front page of /r/mechanicalpencils, the closest equivalent in /r/leadholders would probably be someone showing that they recently acquired a single (or at least single-digit) lead holder. </p>

<p>But to a great extent, I can get onboard with that sort of sentiment. I remember going to stationary stores in Taiwan with my family as a kid and being enthralled by the shelves upon shelves of every kind of writing utensils imaginable. I remember trying pen after pen on the little test sheet to try to find the smoothest one, or running my hand over different textures of paper. My quest, as a kid, was to find the "one" perfect pen, pencil, notebook, binder, whatever it was, that I would then use forever. Looking back, was I picking a pen or a puppy from the shelter? Of course, that never lasted. I often lost things as a kid, so my "forever" pencil or pen invariably got left on the bus, or dropped somewhere, and I'd be back to scrounging up a Pilot G2 or a Ticonderoga from wherever I could manage. </p>

<p>However, the point of writing this article wasn't because of finding /r/leadholders, or even /r/mechanicalpencils. It's another sub entirely, one that I found through /r/mechanicalpencils. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/erasers/">/r/erasers</a>. Compared to /r/mechanicalpencils, /r/erasers is much smaller. At 1000 weekly visitors, it's not as small as /r/leadholders, but much smaller than /r/mechanicalpencils. If we take a step back and think about the nature of these stationary items, they all sort of work in different ways, even though they're often lumped together. We already established that if you've got a good lead holder, pass that bad boy onto your grandkids. If you have a good mechanical pencil, you may be able to pass it on, if it's a Rotring or someone like that, but surely you'll be able to use it for many decades, if not a lifetime. However. What if you have a good eraser? Can you use that for a lifetime? The eraser, by its nature, is meant to be consumed. If it's a good eraser, then one would want to use it, and if one uses it, they will eventually no longer have that eraser. </p>

<p>I want to take a moment to say that I'm not trying to put anyone's decision to purchase anything on blast here. Do what you want with your money. But surely you recognize the irony here, that to some extent, the point of having a great eraser is so that at some point, you will no longer have that great eraser. If you wanted to have that eraser forever, then the fact that it's great is irrelevant. It might as well be an actual brick. And yet if you go on /r/erasers, there are large collections of erasers all splayed out, like jelly cobblestones in Candy Land. Sometimes there are used erasers, but very rarely have I seen one used past 50%, and more often than not, they don't look used at all. Just perfectly geometric rectangular or circular prisms sitting in a phalanx of its brethren. </p>

<p>But at the same time, I feel like I can maybe see the point of these eraser collections, even if I don't have any inclination towards that personally. Some of them are genuinely a very novel and appealing in design, shape, color, mechanism, or some other aspect. But at least to me, that is, at most, a reason to get one eraser over another eraser if I'm already getting an eraser. It is not a reason to collect more and more erasers.</p>

<p>What strikes me the most about /r/erasers, and all the people there with their huge collections is that in light of this irony, that there is an inherent contradiction between collecting erasers and actually using them, is the fact that to some extent, this sub is sort of purely consumption based. What I think is really cool about /r/leadholders and even /r/mechanicalpencils is that they recognize that these are tools to be used, (even if that's more aspirational than realistic given the size of some of the "hauls".) Like imagine if there was a food-based sub, say, /r/ramen, where people showcased not delicious bowls of ramen that they are consuming, but rather collections of packets of ramen like that was the point of "getting into ramen." Actually, I did go to /r/ramen (of course there was one), and guess what, they largely show pictures of bowls of ramen that they have enjoyed. They used the ramen for its intended purpose- consumption. Do the people on /r/erasers use their eraser for their intended purpose? Not a hot chance in icy hell. </p>

<p>I know that this problem is not unique to /r/erasers. I've seen enough YouTube drama to have seen those multi hundred or thousand dollar makeup or book hauls that will go unused until the sun dies. A common saying, especially on the booktube space is that "buying books and reading books are two different hobbies", and I sympathize with that. I have purchased books and never gotten around to reading them before. I have also purchased erasers and not finished them. (I am working on trying to finish my chap sticks, but for someone everyone looks at me like I'm a psychopath.) But I've never purchased books without the intention of reading them, nor erasers without the intention of using them. But if I were to collect erasers, surely that would have to be my goal? </p>

<p>I wonder about the subjective perspective and mental priorities of these people that post huge eraser collections. Because if the point of collecting an eraser not to use it as an eraser, but as a decorative or aesthetic object, then it might as well not be an eraser? It could be made out of hard plastic, clay, wood, ceramic, whatever else. If you don't want to erase with it, then it could be made of anything, and you're just collecting... objects at that point. What is it about the fact that these items are erasers that's both so important to the intrinsic nature of the object in the possessive aspect, but completely disconnected to its utilitarian aspect? I reminds me of Peter Pan Syndrome. J.M. Barrie's oldest brother died when they were young, and J.M. tried unsuccessfully to try to fill his mother's emotional void, to the extent of wearing his brother's clothes and whistling in the same way. Barrie, of course, would go on to write Peter Pan, the story of an eternally youthful boy who never grows up or dies. Are these erasers the same situation? That forever stuck in their Puer Aeternus potentiality, they can always be used, but must never be used, lest they cease to be able to be used?</p>

<p>Chances are pretty good that I'm overanalyzing this, and it just comes down to good'ol capitalistic consumption. Just fill that spot in your heart where being loved should be with more erasers.</p>

<p>1. After a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_pencil#History">Wikipedia search</a>, it seems the oldest lead holder we know of dates back to 1565</p>
