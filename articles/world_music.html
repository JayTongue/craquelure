<p class="indented">As a Person of Color living in the United States, I always thought it was laughable how non-Anglophone (or at least non-Eurocentric) stuff gets lumped together. I'm talking about things like your "ethnic food" aisle in the grocery store. Ah yes, all food with an ethnicity goes here, and the rest of the store, all 99% of it, is without ethnicity. The implications of this tacit normative assumption are expansive, reaching other areas such as literature, theology, visual art, philosophy, and economics. These are all areas that I've been slowly learning to recognize and decolonize.</p>

<p class="indented">One area that I've been wanting to diversity more is music. For most of my life, I've already felt like somewhat of a music outsider. I grew up listening to classical music on the radio and never really consistently listened to anything or anyone on the the top 40. My dad also shared a lot of his music with me, which was stuff like Simon & Garfunkel, Air Supply, or The Carpenters. As a result, any given playlist I make probably have a weird smattering of indie folk, classic pop and rock, acoustic covers, jazz, ska, and a bunch of stuff. </p>

<p class="indented">One way I've always wanted to expand more into was this so-called "world" music, aka music which doesn't fit into the the anglo-centric genres. I have no hard stats on this, but "world music" probably would include most music made by most societies for most of history. Funny how that works. </p>

<p class="indented">As a child of the internet, this music has always been available to me, but I always felt intimidated by it. There's always been some stuff that has interested me (like Balkan dance music after watching </em>Balto</em>), but if you search something like "Japanese flute music" on Youtube, all you really get are weird compilations or pre-made playlists. These may actually be exactly what I would want to listen to appreciate, but it feels unpersuasive, like it's meant to be just something you put on in the background of a white-owned sushi restaurant.</p>

<p class="indented">But the fix I've found to this is to just browse the CD's section of the library. I started doing this when I wanted to listen to some high-quality FLACs. Although I, admittedly, cannot tell the difference between lossy and lossless music, I am also, admittedly, a data hoarder, and lossless is more data, right? That's how that works?</p>

<p class="indented">However, since I'm already looking in that section, I figured I would browse around. Browsing the shelf feels very different from scrolling through a list of Youtube results. As a fellow librarian, I can appreciate that this CD was chosen by a collections development team who made a choice to pick this one. It sits there on the shelf, unweeded, because of its place in an ever-growing collection. It is not a mistake or view-optimized algorithm that placed it there. </p>

<p class="indented">I also get to do a cool thing which is to pick it up, look at the cover art, open the case, and flip through the booklet in there. I like this tactile process a lot. Some of these albums also have tons of art in them. Like the albums for the Korean-Chinese boy band EXO. Their included booklets have full photo spreads in there.</p>

<p class="indented">I also get to make more gut-driven decisions on whether I want to listen to something based on whether or not I like the appearence of the media. There's been a ton of stuff I would have passed over in the online catalog, but ended up checking out and loving because I was able to pick it up and look at it. So I guess don't judge books by their cover, but judge abumns by their cover art?</p>

<p class="indented">Some of my favorites artists that I've found include Dozan, an acoustic ensemble celebrating Arabic folk culture founded by a Jordanian vocalist, and Youssou N'Dour, a Senegalese artist with really unique style.</p>

<h3>Why It's Different</h3>

<p class="indented">One question I was asking myself is why these two ways of discovering music feel so different. This reminded me of the different kinds of information seeking behavior that I learned about in my Information Science degree. One of the more simple and intuitive frameworks was used by <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/634067.634167"  style="color: white">Morrison et al.</a> who categorize information-seeking behavior into four categories:</p>


<table class="tight-table">
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 10%;">
    <col style="width: 90%;">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>Explore</th>
    <td>General searching for information. The search is not triggered by a particular goal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Monitor</th>
    <td>Repeated visits to specific websites to update information. The search is not triggered by a particular goal; it is a routine behavior</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Find</th>
    <td>Searching for a particular fact/document/piece of information. Search is triggered by a goal.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Collect</th>
    <td>Searching for multiple pieces of information. Searcher is open to any answer, not looking for a particular one. A goal drives the searcher's behavior</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
These can roughly be placed on a grid:
<br>
<br>
<table class="tight-table" style="width: auto">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Active</th>
    <th>Passive</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Directed</th>
    <td>Find</td>
    <td>Monitor</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Undirected</th>
    <td>Collect</td>
    <td>Explore</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="indented">Here, active vs. passive searching is determined by whether the seeker has explicit information needs they are try ing to meet. Directed vs. undirected is determined by whether the seeker is looking in a specific place. For instance, looking a word up in a dictionary is an active, directed information seeking (find), whereas looking around for instances of that word's use would be an active, undirected information seeking (collect). Checking the front page of the BBC website every day to stay up with the news is passive, directed information seeking (monitor), but encountering new articles through general web activity is passive, undirected information seeking (explore).</p>

<p class="indented">These categories aren't perfect and there are many nuances and edge cases, but generally I feel like this taxonomy is a pretty good preliminary framework for understanding information seeking behaviors. Note that there's sort of subjectivity to this process. My intentions change what kind of behavior I engage in.</p>

<p class="indented">When I'm trying to discover "World" music online, I feel like I'm "collecting". The reason I'm running a query on that website is to try and gather bits of data (songs, albums, artists) that fit the information need I have, which is to put together music that gets sequestered into that "World" genre. Because this is active and goal driven, I focus in on the criteria that I think will be most irrelevant, which also happens to be the criteria that I'm most ignorant of, which is the quality and suitability of the music to this need. </p>

<p class="indented">Conversely, when I'm at the library, I just open myself to encountering something that fits by chance. I know that there are other albums, e.g. jazz or classical, that I'll scrutinize more carefully because I know more about these artists and names, but when I get to the "World" section, I'm not looking for anything in particular. I don't know any artists, pieces, and am unfamiliar with most labels (I have no intuition what labels like "Gnawa" or "Zouk" mean), so I just pick the case off the shelf and look at it. If it looks like something that will be cool, then I check it out, both in the colloquial sense and in the library circulation sense. </p>

<p class="indented">This behavior is much more exploration than collecting, and so far it's worked out quite well. I'm discovering a ton of artists and sounds that I otherwise would not have. I can let curiosity take over instead of a need to fulfill a goal.</p>
