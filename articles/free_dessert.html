<p class="indented">"Which queue do you want to be in?"<p>
<p class="indented">"Whichever one is fastest, don't you think?"<p>
<p class="indented">"Okay, I'll add us to the tolled queue."<p>
<p class="indented">"Tolled queue?"<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">She turned around from the tablet and took me by the hand. "Yeah, the tolled one always goes faster!" She beemed enthusiastically, leading me towards the door on the right. I follow her inside the dark room. Inside, there is another tablet that says "Welcome, Nicole and Samuel!", with arrows pointing to adjacent seats. Nicole grabs my hand and leads me towards the directed seats. I sit down next to her, and a screen on the far wall comes begins to flash brightly.<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">"What is this?" I ask.<p>
<p class="indented">"It's a tolled waiting room," she repeats. Seeing that I was still confused, she continues. "Restauruants figured that people often have to wait for their tables, so they had the idea to show them ads. It used to just be a few screens in the waiting areas, but people hated them. So then they came up with the idea of giving people a choice. If you wanted to watch the ads, you could go to a separate room."<p>
<p class="indented">"Why would anyone want to watch the ads?"<p>
<p class="indented">"Because you get off the wait list faster. I've never had to wait longer than 20 minutes!" Nicole Beemed.<p>
<p class="indented">"You just watched 20 minutes of ads?"<p>
<p class="indented">"No, I mostly just closed my eyes. No one cares if you actually watch them."<p>
<p class="indented">I sat there and watched as a juicy, vibrant hambuger was pulled from a closeup hand by an actor, who brought it up to her mouth as her eyes widened in anticipation of a first bite. Another hand emerged, holding crispy-looking french fried adorned with ketchup.<p>
<p class="indented">"I always wonder what the point of advertising food is, since we already know what we're eating." Nicole remarked. I nodded, unable to take my eyes off of the flashing animations and logos on the screen. After the burger was an add for a new smartphone, then a car.<p>
<p class="indented">"Why's it called a "tolled" room?" I asked.<p>
<p class="indented">"Oh it's because it goes faster than the normal waiting room, like how you can choose to take the toll road to go faster than the regular highway."<p>
<p class="indented">I supposed that made sense.<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">Suddenly, the screen went dark. I thought something was broken, but after just a few seconds, a suddenly voice boomed out. "Wasn't that nice? Life goes so fast, it can be hard to remember what peace and quiet are like. That's why I count on NextVPN." The screen erupted with NextVPN's graphic animations. "NextVPN can keep you safe from hackers, snoops, and even advertising trackers. Get NextVPN today."<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">Halfway through the next ad, our screen cut off again. I thought that it was a smilar gimick, but the tablet at the front of the screen instead flashed with "Nicole and Samuel, your table is ready for you!" We got up and walked towards the velvet rope in the back of the room. At the other end, a hostess smiled at us, holding menus. Nicole excitedly grabbed my hand and we followed the hostess to a small table. I pulled Nicole's chair out for her, and she awkwardly at got into it, looking slightly embarassed. I've never done this for anyone before, and it seems like no one has done this for her before either. It shows, but we laugh it off.<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">"You know, I'm glad we got to sit next to each other." Nicole says, as we lean over our menus.<p>
<p class="indented">"Yeah, me too." I responded.<p>
<p class="indented">"Some people's ads are weird. I once sat next to a guy whose ads were all for hair loss creams and ED pills. Turns out he was 14 years older than he said his profile said."<p>
<p class="indented">I looked at her, horrified.<p>
<p class="indented">"I know, right?" She gave a bright laugh. "Don't worry though. All your ads were normal."<p>
<p class="indented">I wondered if I ought to have been looking at her ads. I'm sure they weren't to suspicious, but still, I was curious.<p>
<p class="indented">"You know, you can tell a lot about someone by finding out what advertisors know about them," she said, reading my thoughts. "I worked in advertising for a bit."<p>
<p class="indented">"Oh I see. Sorry, I'm new to all this. How did you like it there?"<p>
<p class="indented">"It was fine." I got into it because I liked working with people, but my job was mostly tracking vision lines and counting blinks, and that's not really working with people."<p>
<p class="indented">"Yeah, I can imagine not. What were the vision lines and blinks for?"<p>
<p class="indented">"That's how these companies all test their content. They have a 'boring' with like, every day scenes of a hand tying a shoelace or pouring a cup of coffee or something, and then you have their content. They get a test group, and track their vision and blinks. If too many of them blink at the same time, the company knows that there's a discontinuity in their content. If anyone looks away at the 'boring' screen, then they know they have to make the content more engaging there."<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">A waiter offered us cups of water and asked if we wanted anything else to drink. We both declined.<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">I was suddenly very self-concious of how I had blinked or stared while I was in that room. Did I blink at all? Too much? Only where they wanted me to? "Is this a new thing? I remember watching tv or videos as a kid and they just showed the ad, without having to track anything."<p>
<p class="indented">Nicole nodded. "Yeah, that's the way thing used to be, but then advertisors developed 'bioadvertising', where the viewer's biological data is used to develop the ads."<p>
<p class="indented">I swallowed and reached for the water. "That feels so... creepy" I said after a bit.<p>
<p class="indented">Nicole nodded. "Yeah, but for some people, being in that group is how they make their money. Especially if you're in an extreme minority group, like a Jewish, biracial, squirrel-loving 35 year old retiree, then you can really get a lot of work leading up to major holidays." She shrugged. "But I mean, the world wasn't going to let people walk around and not be advertised to, so they might as well be ads that are targeted towards our interests."<p>
<p class="indented">"I'm surprised we're not being advertised to right now" I said, with newfound sincerity.<p>
<p class="indented">"It's good isn't it?" Nicole's eye twinkled. "Places like restaurants tried that for a bit, but that made the customers too distracted and hurt sales. They realized that what they needed a space to advertise their own menu products, and since people are buying food and drink it really ended up working for their bottom line."<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">The waiter had reappeared, and Nicole ordered first. She picked a Caeser Wrap, which is what I was going to order, so I panicked and switched to a grilled chicken sandwitch. It came with fries anyway, which I felt like I would enjoy. After the waiter smiled and left, I looked again at her. Nicole's eyes were a remarkable light brown, which matched the color of her hair. It looked like she had colored her hair at one point in time, but decided to let it grow naturally. A few light freckles speckled her olive skin like a robin's egg I had only seen before in pictures. She smiled at me and I smiled back. "What do you do now?" I asked.<p>
<p class="indented">"I work in food delivery." She said. "It started as an in-between sort of job, but I more or less do it full time now."<p>
<p class="indented">"That's cool," I said. "I did that for a while when I was in school too. Back then all I had was my bike, so I got really good at climbing hills."<p>
<p class="indented">"Oh man, if I were delivering on my bike I'd have the nicest legs." She laughed.<p>
<p class="indented">"Do you work for a specific company? I remember I used to have like 4 apps open to get whatever deliveries I could."<p>
<p class="indented">"I used to do that, but then I switched to the Common Kitchen app."<p>
<p class="indented">"You haven't heard of Common Kitchen? A few years ago, so many people were ordering delivery that it didn't make sense for, say, a McDonalds to just be a McDonalds or a Taco Bell to be a Taco Bell anymore. If you put in an order for a Big Mac, McDonalds could assign it to any place that could make it, not jut McDonalds kitchens, since it's going to get delivered anyway. A bunch of the biggest places all did this, since kitchens can bid on orders and distribute the demand at peak hours, and since a lot of the Common Kitchens can be closer to you, the food comes faster and fresher, for a lower delivery fee."<p>
<p class="indented">I sipped a little more water. "Woah, that's interesting. How come I see a bunch of places that still say 'Pizza Hut' or something on them?"<p>
<p class="indented">"Oh those are just a storefront. You can go in there and order Pizza Hut items from them, but the kitchen is probably also handing out sushi rolls and hamburgers to delivery people. Sometimes, if the place is only a storefront, then the food you get can be made at another Common Kitchen and delivered to you right there at the joint."<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">The food arrived and we dug in eagerly. The fries were, in fact, very good.<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">After we had eaten our fill, Nicole pulled out her phone. "Want dessert? It's on me!"<p>
<p class="indented">"Sure, maybe? I forgot what they had."
<p class="indented">"Don't worry, we can pick afterwards." Nicole unlocked her phone and started recording video from her front camera. "Hi everyone, I'm on a date at Chicken King, and I just had the best Chicken Caeser Salad Wrap. The chicken was great and the dressing was awesome." She gave the camera a wink. "I'm definitely going to come back here, and you should all check it out!" She stopped the recording. After a few more seconds, she declared "tagged and posted!"<p>
<p class="indented">"I didn't realize you were an influencer" I said, a little sheepishly.<p>
<p class="indented">"Oh I'm not," Nicole laughed, putting her phone away. "I don't have that many people who follow me, but this restaurant has a deal where if you just have a few followers, they let you post and tag them and they'll give you a desert."<p>
<p class="indented">"And that works?" I said skeptically.<p>
<p class="indented">"Oh yeah. Microinfluence is all the rage these days. It a huge part of the advertising market." A waiter came back out to take our plates and gave us a menu again for us to choose our desert. "You pick" she said, offering the menu to me.<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">I ended up selecting cherry pie a la mode, which ended up working well since I realized I liked the pie better than the ice cream, and she liked the ice cream better than the pie. After almost licking the plate clean, we paid our bill and headed back onto the street. At the curb, the awkwardness from the chair flared again, and we stood there for a little in silence.<p>
<p class="indented">"That was fun" I offered.<p>
<p class="indented">"Yeah!" She beamed. "I'd love to do it again sometime."<p>
<p class="indented">"Me too." I replied, matching her smile. She pulled me in for a quick hug.<p>
<br>
<p class="indented">After we let go, I continue down the sidewalk and she crosses the road. I turn my head too look at her, and watch her silhouette disappear into the landscape of flashing neon lights.<p>
