<h3>0. Attention Is All They Need</h3>

<p class="indented">Attention, used in the human sense, is a superpower. There are so many things you can understand and do if you sit down and simply apply attention to them. Attention is also one of the most valuable things you have. </p>

<p class="indented">Imagine sitting down and reading a difficult book. The prose is difficult to understand and you end up having to re-read portions and slow down simply to understand what they author is saying. At the end of it, you are exhausted, but you now have a better command of the information than you did before. Who has benefited from this attention? To some extent, the author. Authors generally want their ideas to be spread. However, the majority of the benefit is to you. You now know something you didn't before.</p>

<p class="indented">Now imagine sitting down and watching a movie. Who benefits from that attention? The studio who sold the movie, but also you for the subjective enjoyment of watching that movie. </p>

<p class="indented">What about viewing an advertisement. Maybe if it was for a product or service you wanted to buy but was completely unaware of the market on, you would benefit a little, but but mostly, the benefit is for the advertiser. </p>

<p class="indented">Your attention is finite in quantity and quality, but it is not set in stone. A jazz musician can listen to a big band and their attention can pick up so much information and richness in that performance that is inaccessible to the average listener. The reason for this is due to the thousands of hours they have put into training themselves to listen for those differences and understand them. The subtle elements of tone and timing, the choice of an articulation or the tuning and balance of a section. </p>

<p class="indented">You can do the same thing, but it is rarely passive. Someone who has merely listened to jazz for that number of hours is not on part with the musician who has labored through them. Similarly, you can read books just to read books, but if you think about them, critically analyze them, and discuss them, you will become a much better reader. You can just watch movie after movie, but what were the movie's themes? Did the characters have interiority? Were they archetypes? Were the archetypes upheld or subverted? In what ways? How was the movie composed shot-to-shot and scene-to-scene? How were the colors graded and what impact did that have on the aesthetics of the movie?</p>

<p class="indented">The temptation is always going to be not to do that, to simply sit back and passively watch a movie. There's nothing wrong with that at all. But I think of that proposition as spending the attention that benefits the movie maker, but not spending the attention that benefits you. </p>

<p class="indented">Watching endless short-form content or video essays is very easy to do. Platforms and creators offer an experience where you don't really need to make decisions. All your videos can come from the homepage. All your music can come from Spotify's "Made For You." All your short form content can come from TikTok's "For You." Song after song, short after short. This is what platforms and creators want. They don't care whether or not they're giving you something you actually want to watch, they just need to give you something you can't look away from. </p>

<p class="indented">Their maximum monetization of you comes if you just consume content after content and never give yourself the benefit of your attention. Challenge and change that. </p>

<h3>1. Use A Browser Over an App Whenever Possible</h3>

<p class="indented">The web browser is a remarkable thing. It takes HTML, CSS, and JS and hides all of it so the only thing users see is a rendered webpage. It is also remarkably democratized compared to many other forms of technology. I can't check my email any better because I know some HTML than you can if you know none. I can also get to that email with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or whatever other browser I choose to use. For a variety of technological, historical, and philosophical reasons, the standards that run the web are open and interoperable. </p>

<p class="indented">This is why so many corporations are trying to get people to download their app. Even if the app is little more than a browser wrapper, it allows them to have complete and total control. You can't disable javascript in an app. You can't use an adblocker extension. You are entirely at the corporation's whim, and they can and will collect as much data about you as possible.</p>

<p class="indented">So when you can, use a browser instead of an app.</p>

<p class="indented">Now, the same logic applies. If it is possible to do something offline (e.g. Notepad) instead of online (e.g. Google Docs), then obviously make that choice too.</p>

<h3>2. Assume Information Is False Unless There Is A Compelling Reason To Believe It Is True</h3>

<p class="indented">This did not used to be the case. In the earlier days of the internet, there was a true information scarcity, and for someone to contribute information to it almost always meant that the information had some plausible or factual or evidentiary basis. </p>

<p class="indented">This dynamic is still visible in many areas of the internet, such as forums where people seek advice and factual information. The idea is that if I ask a question, someone who takes the time to respond to it with an answer likely has good information to share. We had fun interactive dynamics like Cunningham's Law, which states that "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer." There was a satisfaction and prestige associated with being "right" which drove a lot of the information online to be factual. There was also a real cost. For someone to read a post or comment and think of a response took some amount of human time and effort.</p>

<p class="indented">This was before the proliferation of generative AI and the internet's necrosis. Now, creating text that immitates that human time and effort has basically zero cost. While a lot of generative AI can be useful for informative uses, these uses are not the ones you will encounter on many places on the internet. AI bots are actively being used to subvert democracy through misinformation on platforms like Twitter. </p>

<p class="indented">While the incentives for people to post factual information online hasn't changed, the incentives to spam and saturate online spaces have become much more alluring due to the decreased cost. In addition to decreased cost, there are also incentives for people to intentionally misinform. It's one thing if an algorithmic feed is flooded with endorsements for a commerial project. It's another thing if vilifying stories about a minority group are used to foment xenophobia and support authoritarian interests. </p>

<p class="indented">You are worth a lot. Your financial behavior is worth a lot. Your political opinions are worth a lot. People will try to buy it. It begins with your attention.</p>

<h3>3. Know When To Learn, When To Expedite, And The Wisdom To Know The Difference</h3>

<p class="indented">It's really easy to use tools like Generative AI to get out of learning something. You can ask it to write your essay for you. You can get it to solve math problems for you. You can get it to fix bugs for you. However, the tradeoff is that you didn't learn how to do any of these things.</p>

<p class="indented">It's easy to say that all these tools are always bad and that no one should ever use them, but that isn't a realistic approach. Generative AI tools can be a great tool for productivity and learning, but to do that, it's important to be intentional. </p>

<p class="indented">One good heuristic that I like to use is that "AI is for chores". If you use LLM tools for the things you don't know how to do, then it's easy to bang through those tasks and not learn a thing. However, if you have tasks which you know how to do but take a lot of rote iteration, then LLMs can safely be used. </p>

<p class="indented">There are also some ways that you can use LLMs to learn.</p>

<p class="indented">Imagine you have a code problem to solve. You have to write a snippet of code that takes a certain input and gives you a certain output. It would be very easy to just give it the input and the desired output to the LLM, copy the response, and paste it into your code, and move onto the next problem. However, you would have learned nothing. Instead, actually look at the response that the LLM gave you. How did it break the problem down? Did it do it how you would do it? Are all the steps it made steps that you understand? </p>

<p class="indented">Once you feel like you understand how the LLM solved the issue, don't copy and paste it in to your code. Rewrite it manually. You can follow all of the same steps, but writing it should help reinforce your understanding of the code now. </p>

<p class="indented">So when do you use an LLM and when don't you? Well, that's up to you. There are some things that you want to learn, and maybe some things that you don't care to learn. Maybe you want a boost with something that you already know how to do.</p>

<p class="indented">The insidious risk is that of dependance, especially for skills that are cumulative. If you don't read the assigned reading on Plato, then what will you do when you have to write an essay comparing Aristotle to Plato? What about the essay later in the syllabus on Neoplatonism? How would you analyze the major schools of the Spring and Autumn period against greek philosophical thought? More likely than not, you can't. That initial use created a debt that grows over time. </p>

<p class="indented">Worse yet would be your cognitive development. Reading and analyzing texts are difficult, but the point of doing it is for you to get better at reading and analysis. Not only are you dependent now and options to continue without it come with a very high cost, you aren't accumulating the critical skills you could have been gaining from doing the work yourself.</p>

<h3>4. The Internet Is Forever</h3>

<p class="indented">Anything you do or say on the internet can be seen by anyone. Of course, this isn't literally true, but it is a heuristic that survivors should follow. Expect that every status post, update, picture, check-in, or like is going to be on the internet in perpetuity. Sure, the people who have access to you on a platform might see it, but so will a future boss, a malevolent government, a data scraper. Even if none of these see the content, it still be on some corporation's server somewhere, likely hosted by Azure or AWS. </p>

<p class="indented">Think of this like a Miranda warning- anything you do or say <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> be used against you. </p>

<p class="indented">The part that is ever-changing is how. Avenues of monetization used to be relatively narrow. Advertisers used to tell a website that they wanted to run an ad with a certain visibility, for a certain length of time. Then the website would display the ad according to their agreement, and get paid for it. Now, ads dizzyingly complex. Google sells ad spots to the highest bidder in real-time when a search is run on the site. Complex marketplaces manage bids between millions of buyers and sellers in order to chisel out the advertisement-saturated world that we live in. </p>

<p class="indented">The advertisements are also virulent and personalized. The moment you visit a site, the site grabs a ton of information about you- what device you're on, what browser you're using, your screen size, even information like your battery percentage and location. All of this information allows them to develop a "fingerprint" of you. I.e., even if you are not affirmatively identified by something like a login, between fingerprinting and tracking cookies, you are still more or less completely identified. All of this information gets bundled and sold to companies who specialize in advertising data. Since this data can be used to make ads more effective and increase profits, this data, in quantity, can be very valuable. </p>

<p class="indented">Recent trends have indicated that tech companies have exactly zero regard for non-technical barriers to unauthorized data scraping. Anything that can be scraped will be scraped. This is regardless of robots.txt or even copyright law itself. Your presence online will almost certainly be mined for all its worth, fed into training data or large datasets in order to try to enrich someone.</p>

<p class="indented">Once your information is online, it will be gathered and used against you.</p>

<h3>5. The Internet Is Ephemeral</h3>

<p class="indented">If you are able, keep an offline copy of the things you care about. When streaming services started to take over the market share of media consumption for average households, they promised access to way more content than users would want or need. For a subscription fee, users were trained to no longer own the media they consumed. Soon, however, more and more streaming services popped up, and competition for viewership lead licences to become more and more restricted and intermittent. Shows that you once loved watching on a platform may have, at some point, become unavailable on that very platform.</p>

<p class="indented">Books have fared no better. Books which were "purchased" by customers on Amazon have been remotely deleted from their ebooks without compensation. </p>

<p class="indented">Currently, music is somewhat better, but there is no guarantee that this will be the case in the future. </p>

<p class="indented">Video game companies also seem to have a unique distain for the media of previous generations. Games which were beloved might suffer death once when the servers they depended on became deprecated without any way of playing offline, and might suffer death again when the company stops producing any versions of the game, and threatens to sue anyone who does.</p>

<p class="indented">Even colloquially, your favorite youtube channel might get struck tomorrow, and the entire thing deleted without any way of restoring it. Your favorite blog might go offline and never be heard from again. It's easy to push archival work onto large centralized institutions such as the Internet Archive. While these institutions are certainly doing important work and at a scale unfeasible for most people, they are also continually under threat and under funded. If there is something you really care about and you have the ability to save a local copy, then do so.</p>

<p class="indented">Cloud storage is not a replacement for a local, offline copy. Cloud companies wield their Terms of Service agreements arbitrarily. Creatives working on important projects have had their entire accounts deleted because some content analysis tool by the cloud company detects that the files have copyrighted property, regardless of the fact that the account holder is the owner of the copyright. </p>

<p class="indented">A the end of the day, all cloud storage is just someone else's computer. While there are reasonable and legal expectations one can have about these services, you are still subjected to the whims of the company.</p>

<p class="indented">This is especially true with media like photos. One might think that they can just upload all the photos to Facebook and download them again if they need them. However, the photo you get back is going to have been run through a lossy compression. If you're relying on a platform or service to be able to "archive" your media, then you are at risk of losing a lot of that archive.</p>

<p class="indented">We are, and will likely continue to be, in a relative paradise of offline storage. Megabytes of storage used to be the norm, with gigabytes being a luxury. Now, You can get drives at 20$/terabyte, or even less. </p>

<h3>6. Minimize Your Attack Surface</h3>

<p class="indented">An attack surface is the total of all the different ways a device or platform can be attacked. If a website includes a text input like a login page, then that is an avenue for a possible hacker to get into your website, which is why all user input needs to be sanitized. If a device's firmware always checks a server for updates, then a hacker might be able to spoof that server and upload compromised firmware to that device. </p>

<p class="indented">While firmware updates and text input on websites are often necessary, one fool-proof way of avoiding those vulnerabilities is to simply not have them in the first place. </p>

<p class="indented">As a user, this can look a lot of different ways. E.g. don't share extraneous data or don't link services that don't have to be linked. Think like an offensive security tester. What are the parts of you expose to the internet that make you larger than you need to be? What parts can you eliminate to make yourself a smaller target?</p>


<h3>7. Everything Is People</h3>

<p>As more of people's lives become dominated by interaction primarily with a layer of technology, there is a growing belief that those technologies have the moral agency and responsibility for themselves. For example, a healthcare company decides to deny claims by using an AI to classify them. The company then turns around to the insured person and says that they didn't deny the claim, the AI did.</p>

<p>Note that this is very similar to how corporations often act, where an executive will try to dodge moral responsibility for their decision making by saying that it was the corporation's moral agency at work, not their own. The impulse here is the same. Create a mechanism that benefits you, then use it as an accountability sink.</p>

<p>Specifically with technology though, companies often try to pretend that "It's not a crime if we did it with an app." See, for instance, Uber and how they treat their app-based "contractors". </p>

<p>It is very important to see through this facade. When you go on any platform with an algorithmic feed, the platform is going to try to pretend that the human decisions to construct and implement that algorithm are not responsible for its outcome. Facebook subverting democratic elections, TikTok driving eating disorders, Twitter spreading alt-right misinformation. In instances like this, there is an impulse to say something like "The algorithm prioritizes engagement. This material happens to get the most engagement, so the algorithm promoted it." However, a person wrote that algorithm, and in doing so, encoded a value for engagement, and the ways to maximize the value. The fact that they may not have intended for this material to succeed is immaterial. The person is still responsible.</p>

<p>Generative AI tools are currently destroying a lot of the value of online platforms and daily making online life a riskier and riskier prospect. The leaders of these companies have repeatedly publicly more or less shrugged their shoulders and dismissed these ill effects. They just made a technology. The fact that the technology did these things is not their fault.</p>

<p>Sure, it is not entirely their fault, since I'm sure Sam Altman isn't personally generating and disseminating Shrimp Jesus memes. However, that doesn't mean that his decisions are not causal in leading up to your crustacean savior.</p>

<p>It's hard to overstate how insidious this can be. Roku TV's try to show you ads even if you pipe video in with an HDMI cable. Was this just a tech decision or corporate decision? No, this was a decision by people at Roku. HP printers demand a subscription to print a file you have with a printer you have, using ink you have. The people at HP decided to do this. Cisco drops support for 19,000 routers, leaving them vulnerable to remote code execution. People at Cisco decided to do that.</p>

<p>Sometimes the world feels like person vs. technology. However, I think it's always person vs. person. Technologies do not create and proliferate themselves. People will always try to project their role as passive if doing so is advantageous to them. Don't let them. See through the smoke ad the person lighting fires.</p>
