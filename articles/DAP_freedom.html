<p class="indented">My first iPod was the first-generation iPod shuffle. I still remember eating dinner with family at Christmas in elementary school, and my uncle handing out iPods to me, my sister, and a few cousins. My mom remarked at how generous he was since that was just a lot of iPods to be passing around. I held the bright green box with the clear window, looking at a white thing the shape of a stick of gum with simple controls on the front and a slider for off, sequential, and shuffle. The top had an audio jack, and a USB male plug was hidden under a white cap on the bottom of the device. No cable needed. My dad had his laptop with him, so he loaded his iTunes library onto the iPod, and I could rarely be found without that thing plugged into my ears. </p>
<p class="indented">We still had dial-up internet when I discovered podcasts so I wasn't able to feasibly download them myself. I had to ask my dad to download them at his office and bring them home on a flash drive so I could load them onto a the iPod. Once we finally got DSL, I was able to get my own podcasts, and I quickly hit the storage limitation on the shuffle. It had 512 Mb of storage, which was enough for about 5 hour-long podcasts and nothing else. I remember having to be very selective about which podcasts I would want to listen to for the first time or revisit.</p>
<p class="indented">Soon, when I got to middle school, some of my friends were rocking newer and newer iPods, with enviable storage in the <em>Gigabytes</em>! My sister wanted the long and skinny iPod nano, which they brought back in 2008 with the 4th generation iPod nano, but I had moved onto iPod touches which held whopping storage capacities such as 16gb.</p>
<p class="indented">When I got my first smartphone, the iPhone 5c, it quickly took over all of that. I not only used it to take pictures, check my email, and play temple run, it also held all the audio that I cared to sync to it.</p>
<p class="indented">However, fast forward to a few years later, and everything is moving to streaming platforms. I doggedly hold onto my local music files since I'm a cheapskate, and I also had built up an ecclectic collection of stuff that I wouldn't find on Spotify or other services, such as covers by small artists or custom soundtracks to movies, shows, and games I made to listen to while studying.</p>

<h3>Why change?</h3>

<p class="indented">For the last few years, I, like many others, have felt that the internet has become too addictive and enshitified. It became so easy to spend an hour or more scrolling on Instagram or Reddit.</p>
<p class="indented">Apps also started getting more and more bloated. Not only did every single thing become its own app, the apps would fingerprint you like its auditioning for the NSA, bogging down your networks traffic, and hogging memory and storage. I started having to offload apps that I used less frequently even though my phone had plenty of storage.</p>
<p class="indented">iTunes also started doing this thing where if you synced local music, it would count once as "Music" and once as "Synced Media". I found myself having to pick just a few playlists to sync to my phone instead of all my music, or even all my playlists. </p>
<p class="indented">I also started resenting my phone for a variety of reasons. Not only was it time-demanding and lead me to behaviors I didn't really want to engage in, and phone upgrades were becoming pricier, and every day it seemed like user control was being taken away. </p>
<p class="indented">At the same time, I was learning more about computing and taking more and more control of my computer use and digital footprint. This also lead me to be more deliberate with how I interact with technology, which looked a lot like delegating my phone's responsibilities to different items. My notes app became a notebook I carried in my wallet. My camera became a Fuji x70. My reading came from a kobo or a dead tree carcas. </p>
<p class="indented">I also became more deliberate about the data that I kept. In a world where platforms have redefined ownership as a "lifetime license" and "lifetime" has been redefined as "until we change our mind", having a local, offline copy of certain things was very important.</p>
<p class="indented">I also hated how more and more of the media we see and interact with is no longer chosen by us, and is instead chosen by an algorithm. Although I never really used music streaming services, I often felt this dynamic through my Youtube feed.</p>

<h3>Making it possible?</h3>

<p class="indented">The first thing I decided to do was to assess my current collection. All exported, I had about 35 Gb, which was unwieldy, but not impossible to wrangle. Because of the patchwork of sources for those audio files, I had an eclectic collection of file formats with varying amount of metadata.</p>
<p class="indented">I whipped up a Jupyter Notebook which would find all these files and populate their metadata into a SQLite database. I could now query that database, changing the metadata as I wanted to. I made a few playlists by putting their file paths into a .txt file, and could pull the files at those paths into a separate folder.</p>
<p class="indented">I will be the first to admit that I am not an audiophile. Quite the opposite, in fact. While I can certainly tell when speakers or headphones are cheap, I'm not so good at distinguishing stuff from mid-range up. I know that I can't tell the difference between lossless audio and something like an MP3 with a decent sample rate, so these concerns weren't a priority for me.</p>

<div class="centered"><img src="/articles/images/20250508_0049.jpg" alt="Digital Audio Players"></div>

<p class="indented">A few years ago I had gotten a knock-off of a Sandisk Clip (left) because it had an FM radio. I used that for a few weeks while reading up on music audio players, or Digital Audio Players (DAPs). And oh boy, is that a whole hobby. People go on about lossless vs lossy, gapless playback, bit rate, bit depth, and a million other terms. That's not even to mention all the subjective terms. What does it mean for music to be "warm"? "crisp"?</p>
<p class="indented">At the end of all that, many of these DAPs were still quite pricy, so I did what I usually do in this situation, and set up an alert on Ebay, then forget about it. A little while later, someone was selling a Surfans F20 (right) for 40$ instead of the usual 175$ ish because the player was "missing an OS". After doing some research, I was confident that I'd be able to put Rockbox, an open source OS that supports some DAPs. It also had physical buttons, which I desparately wanted after doing everything on my phone for so long.</p>

<h3>Making the switch</h3>

<p class="indented">At first, it was... weird. I had the total control I wanted, and it was unfamiliar. Instead of using iTunes to make playlists and see metadata, now I had SQL and Python. Instead of an OS made by Apple's engineers and designer, now I had Rockbox themes made by community members that could make it look like whatever you wanted.</p>
<p class="indented">A lot of these themes are variations on each other. Someone might create an initial theme, then someone else will find a bug or want to make a change or add a feature, so they'll spin off on the theme and make a new one. For instance, the theme SNAZZ3 inherited from SNAZZ2, which inherited from SNAZZ, which is based on SPAZZ and SNAZZY. Loading these themes is as easy as going to the Rockbox site, finding the desired theme, downloading it, and adding the files to the specified directory path in your player's storage.</p>
<p class="indented">One quick situation I ran into at first was the problem of fonts. Although certain themes will look for certain fonts to import, you can really set any font you want. Although every font supports latin characters, Comparatively few fonts offer full support of all languages. If you're looking for Greek, Hebrew, or Russian, you have a few options, but if you're like me and have song titles and info in many of the difficult languages e.g. Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese, then you only really have to options: A font pack called "GNU-Unifont", and "WenQangYi-Unibit". Both of these are 16px. However, the theme I was using was spaced for 15px. This means that I either had to deal with undisplayable characters, let the visual elements run into each other, or choose a new theme. I switched themes and ended up somehow liking it even better.</p>
<p class="indented">The only issue is that now I have something else to carry around, but that's been an interesting shift too. Instead of having music available at my fingertips at every moment, I have to think about what I'm leaving the house to do, if I can or would I want to listen to music, and if so, remember to bring the DAP and earbuds. I no longer have an easy escape if I find myself stuck somewhere. No auditory lubrication to smooth out the friction of every day life. And when I do listen to music, I feel much more attached to the songs that I've deliberately curated.</p>
<p class="indented">Now, when I'm looking for new music, I go to the public library. I usually have a few CD's that I know I'll be interested in, but I also love browsing the shelves. I can take a CD case off the shelf and look at the cover art. I can open the box and look at the little booklet inside. Some of these are honestly masterpieces (especially the KPop ones).</p>
<p class="indented">I know switching to a DAP probably isn't the right choice for everyone. I can't imagine telling people to manage gigs of files just to have music to listen too. Streaming services have their strengths, but this is the right switch for me.</p>

<h3>ReplayGain</h3>

<p class="indented">I noticed that Rockbox offered a function called replaygain, which promised to change the volume of different tracks so that the overall listening volume is the same. I was really excited about this, since, as an eclectic collector of tracks, I often find myself adjusting volume from song to song. The iPhone, which I was using for music playback until this, offered a smilier functionality called "Sound Check".</p>
<p class="indented">However, after flipping the setting on, nothing really seemed to change. I looked in the manual and found that it says "For replaygain to work, the songs must have been processed by a program that adds replaygain information to the ID3 tags (or Vorbis tags)." Huh. Okay. I looked around for utilities or libraries which could process these tracks. After trying a few, it looks like the best option for me was a python library called <a href="https://github.com/chaudum/rgain3">rgain3</a>.</p>
<p class="indented">I used rgain3's collectiongain fuction to batch though a whole file of mp3's, then excitedly loaded them back onto the DAP. I turned the playlist on, and after flipping through a few tracks, it was clear that it wasn't working. After looking at the docs on the rgain3 repo, I found that it wasn't really working at all. What could be wrong?</p>
<p class="indented">I did some digging, and it turns out that "metadata" for music files are not just one thing. There are different types of metadata like APE or ID3, not to mention different versions of each format. My strategy now was to find which metadata tags Rockbox reads, and then figure out how to attach them.</p>
<p class="indented">This is when things get a little complicated. It turns out that different audio file formats sometimes also have different tags. Okay, well the bulk of my music is mp3. According to the docs, APE tags are also not supported for mp3, with the devs explicitly saying "It is not something we want". That leaves ID3. After some tinkering around, I needed to specify "--mp3-format replaygain.org" in rgain3 for it to work. This stores replaygain information in ID3v2 TXXX frames, which Rockbox reads.</p>
<p class="indented">This took a little bit to figure out since Replaygain is supported on APE, ID3, Vorbis, MP4, and ASF metadata formats. The key is that because the file is MP3, Rockbox only supports ID3 metadata for MP3. This means that in the future, if I were to apply Replaygain to other formats, I might have to specify writing it to another type of metadata file.</p>
