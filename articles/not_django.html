<p class="indented">About a year ago, I started doing Django For Everybody, an online course by Charles Severance. I was drawn to this course for several reasons. I'm a librarian and had just been handed the reigns of our library's website, so learning web apps was very appealing to me. Secondly, Severance himself holds a teaching position in the Information Science School at the University of Michigan. I had just gotten my Master's degree in library and Information Science, so I felt that his approach was one which would appeal and apply to my perspective and experience. Severance also is the author of what, by many metrics, is the most successful online course on Python. Lastly, it was free.</p>
<p class="indented">I also watched an interview with Severance where he said that he hires TA to help run his courses, so I thought why not. I'd give it a shot.</p>
<p class="indented">Note here that I did the course directly through the website (https://www.dj4e.com/) and not Coursera, where I know the course is also offered. The experience on Coursera may be different, but I can't speak to that.</p>

<h3>My Experience</h3>

<p class="indented">Overall, I learned a lot from the course. I had a good bit of background with general python, but never dealt with web apps. The first couple video lectures were very informative and foundational in understanding HTTP and the foundations of HTML and CSS. I also learned pretty quickly that the way to succeed in the course was to follow the instructions. The course has you follow along with lessons by making your own site through pythonanywhere.com. If you followed the installation instructions exactly, then you were fine. However, if you skipped or guessed a step, then you effectively had to delete the app and start over.</p>
<p class="indented">This is also when I found my first warning flag. The version of Django we were supposed to install was 4.2 with Python version 3.9. The current version of Django at the time was 5.2 and Python was 3.13. I understand that there is wisdom in sticking to older versions both for maintenance and pedagogy, but I remember classes in iSchool which used the latest python versions and especially made note of changes as versions came out. I assumed that from Django 4 to 5 was a major revision. Is what I'd be learning still applicable?</p>
<p class="indented">One stand out for the course was the autograder. I understand that, to a large, extent, it was the solution of necessity for a free async online course, but I wish that my in-person classes had autograders too. When you had finished a lesson step, you would submit your pythonanywhere URL to the autogravder, which would send an automated agent to that address to look to see if you had indeed finished that step. This would have saved me so much time in my classes if I could just test and see if I was implementing something correctly instead of having to bother TA's or professors. Although it had some quirks (you had to make sure to do exactly what it was looking for- but again, follow the instructions!), for the most part it works really well.</p>
<p class="indented">What I hated, however, was the peer graded stuff. Sometimes, you'd get an assignment to format, say, a CSS, and then you'd post it to the forum for the course, and people would be able to see yours and give you a grade. You, in turn, were also required to grade other people's. A lot of the feedback I saw and received on these were pretty unhelpful. A comment like "good" with nothing else doesn't really help me understand what I did well or poorly. But, I just brushed this off. After all, the internet is the internet, and I guess the community of takers of a free online Django course are no exception.</p>
<p class="indented">However, what I didn't realize is exactly how many people drop off. The first peer graded assignments I submitted took a few weeks to get graded, but some of the later ones never did. In fact, I'm looking at my module now, and some of my assignments, even a year later, never got a peer grade.</p>
<p class="indented">That frustration aside, I plowed on, learning about Model View Controller, Django generic views, how to configure cookies and user sessions to manage social logins, and a whole bunch of stuff. In total, I honestly feel like I learned a lot.</p>
<p class="indented">Each lesson is pretty standard. You would watch some videos, where Severance shows and demonstrates what the lesson is over, then you would have some kind of assignment, either autograder, peer graded, or a quiz. If it was learning a principle of, say, Django views, then it would likely be a quiz. If you were implementing a change to your site, then it was likely the autograder, or sometimes a peer grade assignment.</p>
<p class="indented">I'm not a web developer. I barely understand HTML, JS, or CSS, and the difficulty of the class ramped up pretty quickly. Soon, instead of being able to just watch the lectures once, follow the instructions, and finish the assignments, I was running into a good number of things I had to debug. The instructions also started becoming less helpful, somewhat be design. I believe the course explicitly said that they begin very easily and give you less and less guidance. The result is that there were times when I got stuck.</p>
<p class="indented">One thing the course is very good at is giving you sources of information. In addition to the videos, there is sample code, and the instructions often just point you to the official Django documentation. I think this is a very good skill to learn, and I was eager to get better at reading docs.</p>
<p class="indented">However, around the lesson AJAX, I hit a rut. I kept getting an error with the autograder even though my page looked and behaved like it should. I didn't know what else to do, so I posted in the discussion for that less that I was having this issue, and couldn't do anything but wait. A few months later, another student posted that they were having the same issue, but besides that, there was no engagement at all. Not from other students or TA's. I looked through sample code to try to figure out where I went wrong, but the sample code seemed to be doing something different, or at least not close enough to try to use on the current assignment.</p>
<p class="indented">And the thing is, this is sort of the overall trend with this course. You'll often find posts that are months to over a year old with issues with the autograder or pointing out issues such as repeated quiz questions, or wanting clarification on some instructions. I even found a post from over a year old saying that the course had an old link in it to documentation from Django 3.0. That is to say, few questions in the discussions could be attributable to laziness or ineptitude. The majority of the posts are seeking help with genuine issues. Keep in mind that the artificial constraints were off the charts. This was a website built on out-of-date Django sandboxed on pythonanywhere.com being run through the black box of an autograder. So many questions just would not have been issues at all in the real-world environment.</p>
<p class="indented">I used to see these and think to myself "Pah. They just have to spend time with it and figure it out" until I found myself in that position. Now I see these posts and think that this is someone who had the motivation to do an uncredited course and could have succeeded in it, if they'd had a bit of help. Something as simple as "The autograder looks for this, which you haven't done even though it looks right and behaves the same way" could have been what helped me and undoubtedly many others continue and complete the course.</p>

<h3>This Site is Not Coded in Django</h3>

<p class="indented">As the title says, I sort of gave up on Django. After being stuck for the better part of the year, I just assumed that I'd never have the opportunity to progress. For unrelated reasons, after almost a full year, I decided to return to the tutorial. I found that my discussion question was unanswered, and in fact looked to have been deleted by an admin, and my peer grading assignment still wasn't graded.</p>
<p class="indented">Is this abandonware? To be honest, I never really had much experience with abandonware. I never gamed hard enough on servers that got decommissioned, or ran embedded software which lost security update and corporate support. In many ways, this course did look abandoned, but I noticed that there was an incomplete assignment on module 1, which must have been added recently. Okay, not entirely abandoned, I guess.</p>
<p class="indented">However, I remembered an experience I had participating in a hackathon, where one of my team members spun up a flask server with what looked like less than 30 lines of python. I decided to nuke the Django project I had on pythonanywhere and start a Flask project instead.</p>
<p class="indented">Taking inspiration from a geeks-for-geeks tutorial, I found flask astonishingly simple compared to Django. Gone are the confusing Model View Controllers, the built-in views, the complex interaction between different scraps of python code. Flask fundamentally just needs one python that tells what content to get rendered into what pages, and that's really it. The articles can go into ./articles/, the robots.txt and style.css goes in ./static/, and the templates, all three templates I need, goes in ./templates/. That's it.</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<p class="indented">On the whole, I'm glad I spent the time I did with the course. I honestly did learn a lot. However, I don't think that it's right for everyone. It ended up not being right for me. If you want to learn Django specifically, I would say try to complete the course, knowing the limitations, such as pythonanywhere and Django version 4.2. If you want to learn about web apps, then feel free to just watch the instructive videos explaining principles. You can skip the tutorial videos where he walks through his specific code. If you're following the tutorial because you want to set up a website but don't necessarily want Django, then I'd say start with a Flask tutorial somewhere else. Django has strengths, but you may not need them.</p>
<p class="indented">In the end, my stated goal in doing the course was to 1. understand web apps/servers better and 2.improve as a programmer. I think that I achieved 1, but not really 2. The web server I maintain at work uses Apache, Drupal, and Laravel, all of which are different frameworks from Django. However, I definitely do understand all of these better because of their analogous functionalities with Django. I also deal a lot with custom HTML, CSS, and JS through a Springhare platform, and these were all things covered in the Django course.</p>
<p class="indented">I think this is course is good, but defective in critical ways. It is halfway in between something like a barely interactive Geeks-for-geeks tutorial and an actual course with interaction and feedback. It allows you to self-pace and is entirely web-based for free, which are a real asset, especially to underprivileged people. However, I'm not ashamed to admit that I was too stupid to figure out what specifically the autograder wanted from me. I don't see that as a knock on my ability, but as just an impasse that I encountered. The autograder says It couldn't find an element. I could point right in the code and the rendered web page where that element is.</p>
<p class="indented">Everyone learns differently. As an instructor, I've seen first hand how this applies both to learning style as well as learning progress. I think that the course could be better in realizing that the sometimes hyper specific requirements of the course is going to artificially filter some people out, who otherwise could have been great at Django.</p>
<p class="indented">Not me, though. I'll take my one python file with 30 lines of code, thanks.</p>
