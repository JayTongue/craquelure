<p>The last rays of sunlight glinted off the dollar store window onto the dirty parking lot show as Jon stumbled past. He was cold, but knew not to go in. He had tried to explain last time that he wasn't drunk, he had just hurt his foot, which is why he wasn't walking straight. The manager had all but spat in his face. Jon kept his eyes down as he last rays of light evaporated into bitterness of the cold night air. </p>

<p>He sat down on the curb, leaning against a light pole on the far side of the lot. Three months ago he had been a nurse. I guess what qualifies someone is a degree and a license, so technically he is still a nurse. But three months ago he had a job as a nurse. He would wake up and check his app which would tell him if he had a shift, and how much the shift would pay. He almost always accepted whatever was on offer and was thankful for whatever he could get. In this area, there wasn't a lot of work at all, let alone nursing gigs.</p>

<p>Three months ago, the hourly rates started getting lower and lower. No matter what shifts he accepted, the app always seemed to know that whatever it offered him, he would take. From over 50 an hour, they sank to 45. Jon thought nothing of it. Maybe it was budget, or maybe some more nurses just came into town. They sank to 40. Jon started being worried. He stopped all spending that wasn't absolutely necessary. Bulk rice and beans. He'd made it through nursing school on a shoestring budget, so he knew how to make it work.</p>

<p>The day the offer dropped to 35, Jon didn't go to work. He was supposed to, but his car broke down. Bad alternator, the mechanic said. There went the rainy day fund, and he had to go with a second-hand part. It wasn't much of a fund anyway. What he didn't have, he just put on a credit card. The only credit card that anyone would give to him was the crappiest one. Super high fees, basically no benefits. But that's how everyone starts, right? You pay things off on time, build a good credit history, and soon you can switch to something better. It was all part of the process. The credit card company had also told him that he had to sign a waiver. The waiver said that they have complete use of his data. They promised to anonymize it, but maybe that changed with some subsequent terms of service he had to agree to.</p>

<p>As soon as Jon's net balance was in the red, The prices in the store started changing. He had walked up to a grocery store check-out with his usual rice and beans. The bulk bags of dried goods sat like cinderblocks on the conveyer belt. The store clerk told him the price. He did a double take. How much was it? She told him again. He said that that couldn't be right. He'd been buying the same rice and beans for the last few weeks. Why was it more expensive now? The clerk looked scared. She didn't know what to say. She offered to call the manager. He said that was okay. He was tired from a shift and just needed to eat and go home. </p>

<p>On his way to work the next day, Jon heard the news broadcaster say that there was something called "surveillance pricing" being implemented in the big grocery chains. Prices are now going to be personalized. Jon wondered if that's what happened to him. </p>

<p>The day the offer dropped to 32 was the day that he also officially became homeless. He had been renting a room, and couldn't come up with his portion of rent. It wasn't more than a week when he was told he had to get out. One morning, someone showed up on their doorstep with a few trash bags of stuff. Jon was told that he had to give him his room. At least the new guy was kind enough to give Jon the trash bags to load what stuff he could take into his car. </p>

<p>This will be good, Jon told himself. Now that rent isn't hanging over him, he could get back on his feet. After all, he could shower at work, so all it is is sleeping in his car for a bit. He'd been car camping a few times and never minded it then.</p>

<p>The first few days were all learning. He didn't want to park at the hospital since he was embarrassed someone he knew might see him. Plus, Rob, the security guy, did sweeps. Walmart was always a legal option, but he worried that it wasn't the safest. He thought about less fancy residential areas, where there are unlikely to be cops, but worried that dogs might sniff him out. He ended up doing a little bit of everything. Keeping it moving was good, he told himself. Don't want to be a burden. Just take every shift you can. Get past the rough patch. It will all be okay.</p>

<p>Jon looked for another rental, but all the prices seem to have spiked as well. Some had even doubled. He wondered if this was surveillance pricing too.</p>

<p>Rates dropped below 30.</p>

<p>One day, the app wouldn't let him log in. He contacted the app contact. It auto-replied with a response saying that this was because of hospital policy. He then called the Nursing Manager at the hospital. She said that they couldn't use him anymore. The housing company had the hospital that he didn't have a valid address, and they can't hire someone without a valid address. </p>

<p>Jon considered what to do next. He thought about diving for a rideshare, but all his stuff was in the car. In the end, he settled on grocery delivery. The work was fine, he thought. Go to the store, pick up the groceries, drive them to an address, take a picture, click the app, and get the next one. He was really wanted to get out of the car and into a real place to live again. He drove 12, 13, 14 hours a day, until he couldn't see straight. It felt like it was taking a long time to save anything. Sleeping in the car was becoming more comfortable anyway. He'd been losing weight. </p>

<p>Four weeks ago, the car broke down. The used alternator had fried the entire electrical system. When he brought it into the garage, the mechanic waved it off. That was the risk with second hand parts, as he explained when Jon made that choice. He could just count it as a total loss with insurance, he said. Jon's heart sank. He'd long been uninsured. The mechanic looked at him, and the stuff in the car. In the end, the mechanic offered to buy it as scrap to sell to a junkyard. Jon agreed. He felt his face burn as he sorted through his stuff down to what would fit in a backpack. </p>

<p>That night, Jon just kept walking. He didn't stop anywhere. He told himself that moving would keep him warm but still he shivered. </p>

<p>The next few days, Jon learned how to act. He didn't belong anywhere, but if he acted like he did, then people maybe wouldn't notice. He made sure not to sit anywhere for longer than half an hour. He made sure to try to act the way other people acted- people who weren't hungry, weren't tired, and weren't scared. He made sure to smile and put on a face like everything was going okay. </p>

<p>There were other homeless people he would encounter, of course. He saw them camped out below overpasses in torn tents and shopping carts. The smell alone drove him away, let alone what he knew about drugs and survival prostitution. He was a nurse, after all.</p>

<p>To keep his mind occupied, Jon would do math. What is a sequence of places he could walk between, and how long could he linger at each stop to fill the day? What is the most efficient way to spend his remaining money on calories? Micronutrients were an afterthought now. As the days got colder and colder, Jon knew that he would need energy to survive. Sticks of butter, it turns out are an unsung hero when it comes to caloric efficiency. But just like before with the rice and beans (oh, how he longed for some rice and beans), the prices kept going up as his remaining funds depleted. His credit card had long been terminated.</p>

<p>In the end, the only place where prices hadn't changed was the dollar store. Jon had grown up learning from his mom that dollar stores were almost always more expensive when comparing price per quantity than other stores, but the fact that they were pegged to a fixed dollar price had made it a lifeline for him. At first he would walk in to purchase the few items he could, taking the chance to warm up his hands and feet. But he was aware that every time he walked in the door, he looked and smelled more and more like he didn't belong. Glances from the employees started as suspicious, then moved towards disgust.</p>

<p>One day, the manager told him that he was trespassing. Jon felt his temper flare. He was about to snap back, but over the manager's shoulder, he caught a glimpse of himself in the domed anti-theft mirror in the corner of the room. He left quitely, trying to not let sobs shake his body.</p>

<p>But now more than ever before, he had nowhere to go.</p>

<p>"Holy shit I think it's Jon" Tanner said. He was on the ambulance that the manager had called. More specifically, the manager had called the cops who had called for an ambulance when it was clear that Jon wasn't responsive. Tanner had been an EMT for a while and had known Jon for a few years, but almost didn't recognize him. He was half his old weight, covered in facial hair, snow, and grime, and his sunken eyes were a thousand miles away. \</p>

<p>They brought him to the hospital. The hospital where he used to work. Nothing could be done. </p>

---------------------

<p>"How did this happen?" The state representative said. He held up a picture of Jon taken post-mortem. He had just told them this story. His staffers had made graphs with the data about how the more desperate Jon became, the less the software could get away with offering him for shifts, the more the housing software knew to raise prices, the more grocery chains knew how to squeeze him, the more the credit card company could sell his data as an easy "mark". </p>

<p>"Congressman, I will be the first to admit that our algorithm isn't perfect." The CEO said. "This is, of course, a tragedy, but what our algorithm does is empower people to make choices for themselves." The CEO folded his hands in front of him. "Wouldn't it be anti-freedom if we told the grocery store that they couldn't make choices on how to use this data? Wouldn't it be un-American if we told landlords that they couldn't decide their own prices?" The CEO continued. "By allowing a diversity of prices, the market can let customers reveal their price preferences by making these choices. That's the only way we can have an efficient and effective economy."</p>

<p>"What choices did Jon have?" The state representative asked.</p>

<p>"Well, he could have shopped for different prices on parts to repair his car." the CEO replied. "I'm sure there were plenty of garages that would have to compete on price, and I'm sure he could have gotten a better part." The CEO continued. "He could have networked and built a support system so that he could have bounced back from setbacks. He could have compared prices between grocery stores as well. Congressman, it's clear to me that Jon ended up where he did because of the choices he made."</p>

<p>"Do you think you think any of you did anything wrong?" The state representative asked. </p>

<p>The CEO leaned back in the polished leather chair. "Congressman, absolutely not. All we did was offer a product or service at a certain price. We did so in response to pure market forces. We had no understanding of this individual's circumstances or identity, or the fact that his choices were interacting with the prices of any other company in the way they were."</p>

<p>"But did Jon do anything wrong?" The state representative asked. </p>

<p>The CEO thought for a beat. "I wouldn't say that he did anything wrong, Congressman. But that doesn't mean that his actions don't have consequences." The CEO spread his hands, offering them to the panel of lawmakers. "After all, the ability to determine our own future and make our own choice, well, isn't that the American dream?"</p>
