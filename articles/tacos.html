<p>You want to try a new restaurant.</p>
<p>You've heard a lot about their tacos. You love tacos. You grew up with tacos, and overall, they're one of your favorite foods. Not to say there haven't been bad ones, but as a general category, you really like them. </p>

<p>There's been a ton of news coverage about this place too, and other places that seem to serve these new tacos. You're really excited. You find a spot on the far end of the parking lot. There's a lot of people here, and you're lucky to get a spot at all. In the distance, you can see that a lot of spots are taken up by construction equipment. Some cranes are lifting a chunk of something big into the structure, and a construction fence and dumpsters block of a ton of spaces. Makes sense as to why the spots are so scarce, you figure. </p>

<p>After waiting for what feels like forever in line, a smiling hostess seats you. Since you're alone, she leads you to a two-top close to the back of the dining room. You gratefully take a seat. A waiter comes a long not soon after to give you a menu and ask if you'd like something to drink. Water would be good, you say. He then apologizes for the construction, explaining that it would have gone a lot faster if the city had given them the power and water they needed.</p>

<p>You open the menu. It's one of those cloth-bound menus with clear vinyl windows so the inside information can be edited or swapped without too much trouble. The cloth feels very crisp, like it hasn't been opened many times. Well, you think, the menus must be new because the restaurant is new. The options listed all have very stylized names and very little description. One is called "Kaibigan", another is called "Cintana", another is the "Omilo" and so on. You can't really make sense of it. </p>
<br>
<p>When the waiter comes back around with your water, he asks if you're ready to order. You ask him if you can get more information on the menu items because you don't quite understand. The waiter says "of course, which one would you like to know more about?" </p>
<p>"All of them I guess, but what is a 'Omilo'?"</p>
<p>He chuckles a little bit. "Well, the only real way to know is to try it, but it contains elements of tortilla wrapped around a proprietary filling."</p>
<p>"Oh so like a normal taco?" You ask</p>
<p>"No, no." He shakes his head vigorously. "It's nothing like a normal taco. It's a whole new taco experience."</p>
<p>"Oh what makes it different?" You ask curiously. </p>
<p>"Well, the ingredients are prepared in a completely different way. The processes that we've used have never been used before. In fact, they are brand new inventions of culinary science.</p>
<p>You look at him hoping he'd say more. He pauses for an awkward moment. "Well, a lot of it is secret, but here's what I can say. Think of all the tacos in the world. Instead of trying to make a taco that is an instance of a type of food called taco, we tried to understand and combine the nature of all tacos."</p>
<br>
<p>You're a little puzzled. "But there are a lot of mediocre or even bad tacos that are out there. Won't that make your tacos bad?"</p>
<p>"That's a risk for sure," he admits, "but we can't sort out the bad ones. For one thing, that would be too difficult and take too much time. Also, our process requires that we have as many tacos as possible. In fact, we're starting to learn that all the tacos in the world might even be sub-optimal for this process!"</p>
<p>"Wait, so can you say anything about the process?" You ask.</p>
<p>He thinks for a bit. "Here's what I can share. We employ many cooks. We give them all of the tacos we gather, and each of them takes a taco and learns how to copy one little bit of that taco. Then when we want to make a taco, we go to each cook and ask them to render that one little bit onto the final product."</p>
<p>"Oh so every cook has a specialization, like a meat station and a garnish station?" You've bussed tables before and are pretty familiar with the division of jobs.</p>
<p>"Oh no," he laughs. "That would require each cook to do way too much. Think more about like a grain of masa or the fragment of a peppercorn shell."</p>
<p>You're astonished. "So, how many cooks do you have? There has to be hundreds, if not thousands of cooks back there." </p>
<p>He nods and smiles. You were finally getting it. "Yes, and in fact, you can see we're expanding our facilities for space for even more cooks. That way we can also have cooks that specialize in reviewing and assigning other cook's work. That way we can improve the overall quality of the tacos. That's a very important part of some of our tacos, such as the Cintana." </p>
<br>
<p>"How much does all that cost?" You feel exasperated.</p>
<p>He points at the menu. It's 25$ for a three taco plate. It's definitely not cheap but also not impossible to afford. "25$? You guys pay for all those construction and cooks on that?!"</p>
<p>He laughs again. "No, of course not. Most of our funding comes from investors."</p>
<p>"Who are the investors?" You ask, genuinely curious. You wonder if there was an explanatory episode of shark tank you ought to go try to find. </p>
<p>"Oh, all the biggest companies and funds in the world," he responds.</p>
<p>"What, like the hedge funds? Venture Capital?" You ask.</p>
<p>"Yup, and others like angel investors too" he says smugly.</p>
<p>"Oh wow, makes sense that this place is loaded." You look around. "If it takes all that money to run this place, why don't you sell the tacos for more?"</p>
<p>"Well we wanted to start with a really accessible price just to build a client base. Once people give our tacos a chance they'll see how much better they are than other tacos, so down the line we can sell the tacos at a profit, and recoup the investment."</p>
<p>You remark "that's a lot of confidence in the tacos. Don't you worry that the reason people are so willing to buy them now is because of the lowered price?"</p>
<p>"Oh absolutely not." He beams. "People are coming because it's a whole new taco experience!"</p>
<br>
---------------------
<br>
<p>You figure you ought to order then. You order an "Amtum" and an "Trudhur". For the last one, the waiter recommends the "Olorin", so you go with that.</p>
<br>
<p>After about 45 minutes you catch the waiter' eye as he walks by. Don't worry, this length of wait is normal, he says. Its just to make sure your tacos are as good as possible.</p>
<br>
<p>At an hour and 20 minutes, the tacos arrive. Eagerly, you pick up the first one and take a bite. As you chew, you think to yourself "It's good, but is it worth the hype?" <p>You'd gotten hungry, so you finish it pretty quickly. You pick up the second one and find that it's acceptable as well. There seems to be a crema sauce in this one. You really like that and it reminds you of tacos that you've had at other places. Maybe those were the places that this place was copying.</p>
<br>
<p>You pick up the last taco and take a bite. At first it's fine, but then you taste something bitter and hard. You waive the waiter over. "I think there's something weird in my taco."
<p>"Impossible," he responds. "Each part of the taco is meticulously curated." He looks at it for a little bit. "Ah, I see what's happened," he finally says. "That's Cassava. Cassava is sometimes used as an ingredient in taco-native regions."</p>
<p>"But I think it's raw," you say. "Isn't raw Cassava poisonous?"</p>
<p>"Well, fresh, vegetable ingredients are a common choice for tacos, so I assume that one of our cooks decided to chose an authentic ingredient and paired it with an authentic cooking method."</p>
<p>"But isn't it poisonous?" You repeat.</p>
<p>"I don't know since I'm not a chef," he says, "but since it's in your taco, I assume that his is a very natural and intuitive preparation"</p>
<p>"But isn't it POISONOUS?" you repeat yourself a third time.</p>
<p>"Sir", the waiter responds sternly. "What we offer is a culinary experience. We take all the expertise of all the tacos across the world and distill it into the tacos we offer today. It might not fit your exact preferences, but our customers are aware of what we offer. They come for what we offer. This place is packed because of what we offer."</p>
<p>You swivel your head and take another look around. The place, inexplicably, was indeed packed.</p>
<br>
<p>He continues. "Our customers are aware that the tacos they get are the product of a unique, specialized process. They know that they ought to double check all the ingredients when their tacos arrive. It even says so on the menu!" He pointed at the menu. As your gaze follows his finger, it encounters the smallest, most ignorable text you have ever seen in a grey font barely visible against the background color of the menu."</p>
<p>"How many people do you think actually read that?" You ask.</p>
<p>"I'm sure they all do," he responds, "or at least they should."</p>
<p>You roll your eyes. from your tenure in the restaurant industry, you know first-hand how a tiny line of text on a menu might as well not be there. "How should customers check the ingredients? Do you provide them with an ingredients list?" </p>
<p>"Oh no, we can't do that." He shakes his head. "That would reveal far too much about our proprietary process."</p>
<p>"So then how is anyone supposed to avoid stuff like this?" You gesture towards your offending taco.</p>
<p>His eyes fill with earnestness, as if what he was going to say was the most natural thing in the world. "By checking the tacos before they eat them, of course."</p>
<p>He gets flagged by another diner and apologetically hustles away.</p>
<br>
---------------------
<br>
<p>After you take a last sip of an also overpriced hibiscus ice tea, the waiter appears again to clear away your plates and ask if you want to order a desert. You say no, that you're ready for the check. When the check comes, it's, unsurprisingly, expensive. But you remind yourself that this is just a fraction of the total cost of the food. Does that make you feel better about it? You're undecided. </p>
<br>
<p>When the waiter comes to give you your card and receipt after collecting the check, you offhandedly remark "Well, I hope things work out for this place."</p>
<p>He exclaims "Oh of course they will! In fact, we see this restaurant taking over all the other restaurants."</p>
<p>"Like in this corner?"</p>
<p>"No, in the world!"</p>
<p>You look at him while he beams excitedly. "Why is that?"</p>
<p>"Well," he takes a slight pause. "We really believe that our tacos are what people want. In fact we think that we can deliver tacos to customers that they don't even know they want. Brand-new ingredients in brand-new combinations, prepared in brand-new ways! Every other customer doesn't even get a menu! They just describe what they want, and the cooks make it for them."</p>
<p>"But does that make the tacos better?" You ask.</p>
<p>He gives a bright laugh. "Well, surely it does, or this would have all been a giant flop, wouldn't it?"</p>
<br>
---------------------
<br>
<p>You decide not to try to engage that question. You sign the check, thank him politely, and walk out of the door, brushing past a line which seems to have only gotten longer from when you were in it.</p>
